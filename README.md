# very_simple_organism
My capstone project, I am trying to emulate how a organism with a simple CNS might learn and navigate. 

How to get it running:
<br /><br />

Python:
<br />
-> Create a venv file nearby that you can use as an interpreter. 
<br />
-> Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the dependencies to your venv; 
the requirements.txt file is included in the repository. 
<br />
-> Run the project from main.py. 
<br /><br />

C++:
<br />
-> The C++ code is accessed from the file "
<br />
-> There should already be a "cpp_code\main.so" file.
<br />
-> If you modify the C++ code, 
use "g++ -O2 -fPIC -shared -o main.so main.cpp" from 
command prompt (from the "cpp_code" folder) to compile it again.
	-> I used g++ 64 bit.
	-> You can use it with another optimization setting if needed.
<br /><br />
